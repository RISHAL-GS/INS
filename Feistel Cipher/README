# 🔐 Feistel Cipher

This project implements the **Feistel Cipher**, a symmetric structure widely used in block cipher designs. The Feistel network divides plaintext into two halves and applies multiple rounds of encryption using a round function and subkeys.

## 📜 Overview
The **Feistel Cipher** is the basis for many modern encryption algorithms like **DES**. It operates by splitting plaintext into **left (L) and right (R) halves** and applying a function `F` combined with subkeys.

### 🔑 **Encryption Process**
1. Divide the plaintext into `L` (left half) and `R` (right half).
2. Apply the Feistel function `F` to `R`, then XOR with `L`.
3. Swap halves.
4. Repeat for multiple rounds.

### 🔓 **Decryption Process**
- The decryption process is identical to encryption but with subkeys applied in reverse order.

## 🛠️ Features
- Implements **multiple rounds** for increased security.
- Uses a **simple round function (F)** for demonstration.
- Supports **encryption and decryption**.

## 🚀 Setup and Installation
### 📌 Prerequisites
